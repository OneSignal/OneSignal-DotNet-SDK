### OneSignal .NET SDK
[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OneSignalSDK.DotNet)

---

⚠️ Migration Advisory for current OneSignal customers

Our new [user-centric APIs and v5.x.x SDKs](https://onesignal.com/blog/unify-your-users-across-channels-and-devices/) offer an improved user and data management experience. However, they may not be at 1:1 feature parity with our previous versions yet.

If you are migrating an existing app, we suggest using iOS and Android’s Phased Rollout capabilities to ensure that there are no unexpected issues or edge cases. Here is the documentation for each:

[iOS Phased Rollout](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/update-your-app/release-a-version-update-in-phases/)

[Google Play Staged Rollouts](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6346149?hl=en)

If you run into any challenges or have concerns, please contact our support team at support@onesignal.com
